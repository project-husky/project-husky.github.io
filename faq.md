## FAQ Frequently asked questions

### Why do we need HUSKY Health Usability Key?
Opting for recognised standards in the eHealth environment is generally welcomed, and in some cases even laid down by the law.
But often the necessary know-how is lacking and can’t be acquired so quickly because of the great complexity involved. This means that people regularly resort to proprietary solutions that aren’t interoperable.
The project HUSKY is a convenience application programming interface that lowers the barrier to entering the world of eHealth standards, providing an incentive to create a harmonised, connected healthcare system.

### Can I use HUSKY without a licence and with no fee?
Yes. The HUSKY project is a so-called FOSS or free and open source software that’s available on [GitHub](https://github.com/project-husky/husky).
However, as is customary for FOSS, the relevant licences for free software apply. In the case of the HUSKY project, they are the [Eclipse Public License v1.0](https://github.com/project-husky/husky/blob/master/License.md) for the source code and the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International [Creative Commons License](https://github.com/project-husky/husky/blob/master/README.md#license) for the documentation.

### If I develop extensions to the HUSKY project, do I have to share them?
No. But by their nature, free open source projects involve an element of give and take.
It makes sense to work on functionalities and modules on a common basis so that they are open to all users. This also applies to extensions.
Naturally, commercial products that have to use parts of the HUSKY project don’t have to be disclosed.

### I’d like to learn more. Are training courses on the HUSKY project available?
Currently there is no training programme for the HUSKY project. However, you can find documentation for developers on [GitHub](https://github.com/project-husky/husky#the-husky-library) and contact us at husky@ihe-suisse.ch if you have questions about the project.
